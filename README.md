Cordova - Email Composer
====================================
### Supports custom attachment filenames

PhoneGap plugin that allows you to add attachments and specify filenames of attachments to an email compose window. This is a modification of the original email composer plugin in the [purple cabbage phonegap plugin repo](https://github.com/purplecabbage/phonegap-plugins), which itself recommends that devs keep and maintain their own repos of the plugins. 

It has been modified so that you can add filenames to attachments, and has support for Cordova 3.X.
